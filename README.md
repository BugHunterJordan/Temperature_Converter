# Temperature Converter
A Python program that converts temperatures between **Fahrenheit**, **Celsius**, and **Kelvin**.  
The program asks the user which unit they are entering and outputs the temperature in the other two formats.  
Input validation ensures the program handles invalid unit codes and out-of-range temperature values.

## About the Project
This project demonstrates Python skills, including working with user input, conditional statements, mathematical operations, validation checks, and formatted output.  


## Skills Practiced
- Python **input handling**  
- **Conditional statements** (if, elif, else)  
- **Mathematical operations** for unit conversion  
- **Validation checks** for user input and value ranges  
- **Formatted output** using `format()` and `sep` parameters
